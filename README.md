# SCMStandz
This is the public repository of the MOSAiC Single Column Model Working Group (MSCMWG). The overall objective of the MSCMWG is to foster research based on MOSAiC observations and facilitate the comparison and reproducibility of results from different projects. This requires sharing the initialization, forcing, and validation merged datasets used to drive models.

The purpose of this repository is to publish the code 'recipes' for generating these merged datasets. This public repository is the companion to a private repository in which the development of these recipes occurs. If you would like to contribute to this effort, please contact dcsewall [at] ucar [dot] edu.

The merged datasets use the Merged Data File (MDF) format: [https://gitlab.com/mdf-makers/mdf-toolkit](https://gitlab.com/mdf-makers/mdf-toolkit).
