# SCMStandz
This is a collection on Single Column Modeling Standardisation.
While the aim is to coordinate our effort, this repository includes:
* format specification
* overview of group principles
* overview of model cases, challenges, and links to datafiles 
* wiki --- see further guidelines in the [wiki](./documents/wiki/main.md "wiki")
* minutes from meetings --- see folder [minutes](./documents/minutes/ "minutes")
* various utility scripts

Due to the large scale of the forcing files and other datafiles, datafiles are not meant to be uploaded here unless an exception was agreed on.

## Ways to contribute

Your contribution to SCMStandz could be:

* A new single column model dataset;
* A presentation, documentation or new paper on a dataset;
* Scripts for processing or creating datasets;
* Or just fixing typos, adding information, and improving documentation.

### If you are new to GitHub and Git

If you are totally new to git and GitHub, you can try some short tutorials:
* [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github "Introduction to GitHub"),
* [Git and GitHub Introduction](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github "W3 School").

### Add a new dataset

When you are planning to add a new dataset, upload it via SWIFT (see [SWIFT guidelines](documents/wiki/swift_data_sharing_wiki.md "guidelines Data sharing with DKRZ swift")) and add it as a new issue (use "Issues" tab at the top of the page [issue](https://github.com/SCMStandz/SCMStandz/issues "link to Issues tab")).
Further reading: [SWIFT overview](./documents/presentations/SWIFT_overview_NielsFuchs.pdf "Niels presentation on datasets on Swift") (A template will be added later). 

### Add a document or script

When you have a presentation, guidelines, documentation or processing script, you can add it directly to a relevant folder.
* You can directly upload it through web interface ([how to upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository "GitHub guidelines on upload"));
* Or if you are familiar with Git, from the command line.

### Change or update a file

If you are about to make some substantial changes to existing scripts and files, please create it as a pull request (see [creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request "guidelines for creating a pull request")). This leverages the power of version control systems such as Git and GitHub.
